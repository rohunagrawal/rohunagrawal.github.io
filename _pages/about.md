I'm a senior at Caltech majoring in Applied and Computational Mathematics, minoring in Computer Science. Currently, I am a member of [Georgia Gkioxari's](https://gkioxari.github.io/) lab at Caltech. Previously, I worked with [Dr. Oscar Leong](https://www.oscarleong.com) in [Katie Bouman's Computational Cameras](https://computationalcameras.org) lab.

Last summer, I was a Machine Learning Intern at Apple on the Media Analysis team. I have also interned at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

My interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, neurosymbolic AI, and multimodal learning. My primary research goal is to determine how to best add structure to visual priors to improve embodied intelligence and reasoning.
