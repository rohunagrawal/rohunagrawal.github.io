I'm a Computer Science PhD student at <a href = "https://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Columbia</a> co-advised by <a href="https://goldblum.github.io/">Micah Goldblum</a> at Columbia and <a href="https://izmailovpavel.github.io/">Pavel Izmailov</a> at <a href = "https://engineering.nyu.edu/">NYU</a>. I recieved my B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from <a href = "https://www.cms.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a> where I worked with [Georgia Gkioxari](https://gkioxari.github.io/) on visual reasoning and in [Katie Bouman](https://computationalcameras.org)'s lab on imaging inverse problems.


My current interests revolve around planning, exploration, and visual reasoning.

I've also interned at Apple training large video models, and at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory calibrating GPR models.

Currently, I am a member of [Georgia Gkioxari's](https://gkioxari.github.io/) lab at Caltech. Previously, I worked with [Dr. Oscar Leong](https://www.oscarleong.com) in [Katie Bouman's Computational Cameras](https://computationalcameras.org) lab.

Last summer, I was a Machine Learning Intern at Apple on the Media Analysis team. I have also interned at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

My interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, neurosymbolic AI, and multimodal learning. My primary research goal is to determine how to best add structure to visual priors to improve embodied intelligence and reasoning. -->
